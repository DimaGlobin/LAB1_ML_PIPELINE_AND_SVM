# LAB1_ML_PIPELINE_AND_SVM

## Description

This is project is the forst laboratory work in **MIPT ML course**. I studied behavoir of different machine learning algorithms and compared them by metrics 
(*accuracy*, *ROC-AUC curve*). The main task is *one-class and multiclass classifications*.

I've also used **PCA** to decrease space dimention and other **Feature engineering** tools to decrease *loss*.

## Results of research

I researched some ML algorithms:

+ Logistic regression
+ Decision trees
+ Bagging
+ SVM

The best algorithm for this task is **SVM** with **RBF-kernel**. **Logistic regression with Polynomial features** was also not bad, but **SVM** classified 
linearly inseparable batch better. You can see it at graphics in my lab.
